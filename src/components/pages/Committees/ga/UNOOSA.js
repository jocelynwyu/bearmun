        skill="Skill Level: Novice"
        description="Welcome to 2200, where humanity has made it to Mars. Nations with space programs have sent delegations to set up camp, and each established their respective country on the new frontier. For the last 50 years, society on Mars has been developing, quickly stepping through the industrial, medical, and communication revolutions that Earth had followed centuries before. However, the UN Office of Outer Space Affairs, UNOOSA, has not been able to agree on centralized policies since the Space Race in the 1990s. As a result, international law was thrown on the back-burner when private and public space companies alike began regularly transporting humans to Mars. As delegations in UNOOSA, you are tasked with creating policy cognizant of the conditions present on the planet, while trying to avoid situations that Earth faced. As Mars has entirely different atmospheric conditions, unfamiliar implications on healthcare, and no way of addressing stateless transports from Earth, the planet has begun to see climate change, declining public health, and a refugee crisisâ€”a few issues among the many that you'll need to consider as you shape the future of international space policy."

        bio11="Hey everyone!"
        bio12="	Iâ€™m Drishti (she/her), one of your chairs this weekend for whatâ€™s to be the BEST GA ever ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m so excited to meet all of you and see how you navigate the futuristic twists and turns that are bound to be present in this committee."
        bio13="	A little more about me: Iâ€™m a fourth year Data Science major at Cal and Iâ€™ve been in UCBMUN since my freshman year. Currently, I serve as the General Assembly Head Delegate for our club, something that I thoroughly enjoy doing in my free time. This is my first time chairing BearMUN, but Iâ€™ve staffed UCBMUN (our college conference) four times. I vice-chaired the SAd-Hoc in 2022, was chief of staff external in 2023, chaired Lok Sabha (spec) last conference, and canâ€™t wait to chair UNOOSA with Mye. On the circuit I compete only in GAs, and love the collaborative aspect the activity brings to the table. Iâ€™ve met a bunch of amazing people in my three years competing, and am so excited to start the end of my MUN career with this committee :)"
        bio14="	I was born in India but moved to the Bay Area when I was 2, and have been here ever since. If youâ€™re looking for recs on what to do in your free time at this conference, Iâ€™m definitely your person to ask. In my free time I love adding onto my Lego collection, building jigsaw puzzles, trying out new recipes, and watching cricket. I also love discovering new TV shows and have recently started watching The Crown and Baby Reindeer (highly recommend but kinda morbid)."
        bio15="	This committee will definitely be a committee of all time, and canâ€™t wait to see the unique ideas you all come up with. We encourage you to be creative with your solutions! There will be a lot of room to collaborate, so please make sure to have tons of fun! Iâ€™m thrilled to be chairing this committee, and am looking forward to meeting all of you and bonding with you. See you very soon and hope youâ€™re ready for it!"

        bio21="Dear Delegates,"
        bio22="My name is Mye Makornwattana, and I am elated to be serving as the Co-Chair of the UNOOSA committee at BearMUN 2024, which discusses the exciting prospect of space travel and all its implications. I am originally from Thailand, and am currently a junior at UC Berkeley pursuing a degree in Molecular & Cell Biology on the pre-medical track. Back in highschool I, too, was a part of the Model UN team, and I have loved it ever since. MUN has been a driving force in my love for public speaking and expanded my knowledge in fields such as policy, international affairs, and public health thoroughly. Some of my best high school and college memories have been due to Model UN, and it has fostered my confidence both as a delegate in committee and an advocate for global issues outside the context of MUN â€“ I hope that after your experience at BearMUN 2024, you share the same sentiment."
        bio23="As you navigate this committee, I encourage you to consider the nuances that come with unprecedented technologies such as space travel â€“ these are ideas that will remain relevant throughout our lifetime as we are lucky to live during such a time of development and innovation. Therefore, we must recognize the implications our actions have on equality, healthcare, climate, and more."
        bio24="I hope to see your passion shine through in your speeches, that your experience will empower you as a changemaker in fields that impassion you, and that you learn valuable lessons about global policy, collaboration, and altruism. Most importantly, have so much fun, and make the best of friends and memories."
        bio25="Looking forward to a weekend of fruitful debate. Goodluck!"

        // bio2=" Sophia Martinez (she/her) is an English major from Orange County, California, and will be a sophomore this upcoming academic year. She joined Berkeley's Model United Nations club to better her speaking abilities and become more involved with this campus. With how many great people she has found through this club, she wanted to become more involved as a new member and join the Secretariat for BEARMUN! Some other groups she is involved with are Berkeley PAD and the ASUC Student Union, where she works as a lead barista. Outside of academics, she loves listening to music (Fiona Apple and Lana Del Rey are some of her favorites!) and playing tennis with her coworkers. She is incredibly excited to work with everyone and ensure BearMUN is fun and successful for all groups involved.
